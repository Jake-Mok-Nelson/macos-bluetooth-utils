# macos-bluetooth-utils
Scripts to delete and add my Bluetooth devices. Used for switching between laptops.

Bluetooth devices paired to one mac will not connect to a second until unpaired.
These scripts are just a utility to help me move between devices.

`./disconnect_and_forget.sh` when done with one device and
`./connect` when starting to work with another.
